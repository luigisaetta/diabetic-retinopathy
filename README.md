This repository contains the best code I have developed working on Kaggle (2015)
Diabetic Retinopathy Detection competition dataset

see: https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection

I have:
* taken the dataset from Kaggle
* processed images and packed in TFRecords file, for fast training on GPU
* developed models based on TF 2.3, CNN (Efficient Net)

Best result obtained:
* Train accuracy: 0.865
* see also my (late) submission on Kaggle, best score is: **0.72261** (around 30-place)
